Question 1
When managing the end conditions of a game in React, which method is best to reset the game state for a new game?

Calling a method that sets the state back to its initial values
Directly modifying the state variables
Using the componentWillUnmount lifecycle method
Using the component's constructor to reinitialize the state

2.
Question 2
What is the initial state of the  dice  array in the Tenzies game setup in React?

An array of random numbers between 1 and 6 for each die
An array of numbers from 1 to 10 for each die
An array of objects with each object containing a number between 1 and 6
An array of null values

3.
Question 3
In a React application, when mapping an array to render multiple  Die  components, what is the main reason for assigning a unique  key  to each component?

To apply specific styles to each  Die  component
To help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed
To ensure that each  Die  component renders independently
To pass unique data to each  Die  component

Question 4
What is the primary purpose of adding a button to roll and update the dice in a React application?

To improve application performance
To display static content
To allow user interaction
To manage application state

Question 5
In the context of a dice game in React, what is the primary purpose of implementing a hold functionality for individual dice?

To reset all dice values to their initial state
To allow players to retain certain dice values between turns
To automatically roll the dice for the player
To increase the number of dice in play

Question 6 (checkboxes so multiple answers can be valid)
Which of the following practices can enhance the accessibility of a React game for users with disabilities?

Ensuring keyboard navigability throughout the game
Providing video captions and transcripts
Using color alone to convey important information
Providing alternative text for images

Question 7
What is the most efficient way to generate an array of 10 random numbers in JavaScript?

Use a while loop and Math.floor()
Use Array.prototype.map() with Math.random()
Use Array.prototype.filter() with Math.random()
Use a for loop and Math.random()

Question 8
In the context of converting dice values to objects in React, which of the following is a primary benefit of using objects over traditional arrays?

Objects allow for more descriptive properties, such as color and material, in addition to the value of the dice.
Objects are faster to iterate over than arrays when processing dice values.
Objects automatically sort the dice values in ascending order.
Objects use less memory than arrays when storing dice values.

Question 9
In a React application, how can you conditionally style a dice element when it is held?

Use a switch statement inside the render method to change the dice element's class based on its state.
Create a separate CSS file for the held state and import it when needed.
Directly modify the CSS file to change the styles when the dice is held.
Use a ternary operator within the  className  attribute to apply a specific CSS class based on the dice's 'held' state.

Question 10
When creating a Die component to display individual dice in React, which of the following methods is the most appropriate for maintaining the state of the rolled value?

Using the useState hook to manage the rolled value state
Declaring a global variable to store the rolled value
Passing the rolled value as a prop from a parent component
Storing the rolled value in a ref using the useRef hook
