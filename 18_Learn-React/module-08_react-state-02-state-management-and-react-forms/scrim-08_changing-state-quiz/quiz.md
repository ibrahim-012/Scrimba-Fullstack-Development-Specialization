1. You have 2 options for what you can pass in to a
   state setter function (e.g. `setCount`). What are they?
   1. Pass the new version of state that we want to use as the 
      replacement for the old version of state.
   2. Pass a callback function. Must return what we want the new
      value of state to be. Will receive the old version of state
      as a parameter so we can use it to help determine what we want 
      the new value of state to be.


2. When would you want to pass the first option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?
   
   Whenever we don't really care about (or need) the old value,
   we simply want to set a new value.


3. When would you want to pass the second option (from answer
   above) to the state setter function?

   Whenever we do care about the previous value in state and need
   it to help us determine what the new value should be.
